### Repository

Bootcamp - Portfolio.  
An organized and effective way to show the projects that Rui Belo has been involved in this Bootcamp.

### Description

The Bootcamp Portfolio website is divided into six elements:

**Header**  
Includes a navigation bar with the brand name on the left and a link pointing to the Home Page, and on the right side are the **About Me**, **Work**, and **Contact Me** links pointing to the respective sections on the website.

**Section Bio Box**  
Right after the top bar, there is the "Snowy mountains with blue sky" image, which occupies the entire navigation element.  
And it has a floating bio box with a paragraph and a callout.

**Section About Me**  
A block text where some of the skills are highlighted.

**Section Work**  
Section where will be published the most recent projects.

**Section Contact Me**  
Here is where the contacts are found.
