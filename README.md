### Repository

Bootcamp - Portfolio.  
An organized and effective way to show the projects I have been involved in this Bootcamp.

### Description

The Horiseon marketing agency website is divided into five elements:

**Header**  
Includes a navigation bar with the brand name on the left and a link pointing to the Home Page, and on the right side are the Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing links pointing to the respective sections on the website.

**Navigation**  
Right after the top bar, there is the "Digital Marketing Meeting" image, which occupies the entire navigation element.

**Section**  
On the left side with four articles Search Engine Optimization, Online reputation management, and Social media marketing, with their descriptions and images, where each of the titles is the destination of the links from the Header.

**Aside**  
On the right side with three sections, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management, and their icons and descriptions.

**Footer**  
The footer is where the copyright is found.

### Contributing

Why you should contribute to an open-source project?  
Contributing to open-source is a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill.
You don’t have to contribute code, there’s always a task for you on an open-source project.
