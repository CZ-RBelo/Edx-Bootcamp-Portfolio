### Repository

Bootcamp - Portfolio.  
An organized and effective way to show the projects I have been involved in this Bootcamp.

### Description

The Bootcamp Portfolio website is divided into six elements:

**Header**  
Includes a navigation bar with the brand name on the left and a link pointing to the Home Page, and on the right side are the **About Me**, **Work**, and **Contact Me** links pointing to the respective sections on the website.

**Section Hero Banner**  
Right after the top bar, there is the "Digital Marketing Meeting" image, which occupies the entire navigation element.

**Section About Me**  
Cool text about me.

**Section Work**  
Here is where I will publish my most recent works.

**Section Contact Me**  
Here is where the contacts are found.

**Footer**  
The footer is where the copyright is found.
